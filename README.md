# Plotting Raster Data in R
To run this script, you will need these libraries installed in your computer before you attempt to run it: `rnaturalearth`, `ncdf4`, `raster`, `tidyverse`. The first line of the script will tell you how to do this if you are not familiar with package installation in `R`.  
  
It is best if you clone or download this entire repository to your computer instead of attempting to run the script only. Once you have all files in your computer, open the R project file: `Plotting_Rasters_R.Rproj`, this way you will not need to change any file paths.
